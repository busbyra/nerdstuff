'''
This is just a very rough raft for creating a character for 'Degenesis'.

1. Choose Culture, Concept and Cult

2. Spend Points: 
    -10 Attribute.  Attribute max is 3. 
    -28 skill points. Skill Max is 2.
    -Potential bonuses from CCC give +1 each to the max.

3.  Spend points on background. 6 backgrounds, no trait above 3.

4.  Determine Rank:
    - The character climbs his cult's rank hierarchy until he is unable
    to meet the requirements for the next rank.
    - Collected equipment and bonuses are noted on the character sheet.

5.  Choose Potential:
    -The character gets a cult-specific or common potential at level 1.

6.  Finishing Touches.
